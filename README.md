## Info
The main problem that made me create my first extension for Chrome is the Youtube search engine. Everytime I decide to search video - channel or gaming video, results are flooded with sections as 'For you', 'Related to your search' and so on. I want things to happen quickly, so I created this extension as a joke to speed up my searching and show only the results from the search :D
 
Overall, my plan is to update this extension regularly amd add more new features that make surfing the web faster and better, so stay tuned for updates!

Don't try to find this extension in Chrome extension store, you won't find it and I don't plan to upload it there!
 
Features:
- Cleaner Youtube search page - options to remove shelfs as 'For you', 'Related to your search', 'Searches related to...', 'Latest from...', 'Watch again';

Only works for english language (for now)!

**Info: The YouTube component of the extension is written in very short period of time, so sometimes it fails to filter all youtube shelfs and needs page refresh, but overall it's working fine :D I'll appreciate sharing bugs or helping me improving this project with improved and new features!**
 
## How to use
